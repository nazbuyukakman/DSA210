# üç´ Menstrual Cycle & Sweet Consumption ‚Äî DSA210 Fall 2025 Project

---

##  Motivation
Many people report that they crave sweets or chocolate more intensely **when they are on their period**.  
This project aims to test that idea using **real self-recorded data**.  
Is there a measurable difference in my sweet consumption **during menstruation** compared to other days?

By collecting daily data on sweet intake and period status, this project seeks to uncover whether this common belief has statistical support. The goal is identifying if being on a period correlates with increased sugar cravings or dessert consumption.

##  Data Sources

| Data Type | Source | Description |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| **Period Tracking Data** | Personal log (Clue, Flo, Apple Health, or manual entry) | Daily record of whether I am on my period (1 = yes, 0 = no) |
| **Sweet Consumption** | Self-recorded daily intake (portion count, grams) | Quantitative measure of how much sweet food was consumed each day |
| **Purchase Data (Optional)** | Getir, Yemeksepeti, Trendyol Go order history | Used to validate or supplement self-reported sweet consumption |

##  Methodology

1. **Data Collection:**  
   - Track daily sweet consumption using a simple self-log (e.g., how many sweets/desserts consumed or a 1‚Äì5 craving scale).  
   - Mark each day as **"on period" (1)** or **"not on period" (0)** based on personal tracking apps like Clue or Flo.  
   - Gather order history from apps such as Getir or Yemeksepeti to confirm sweet purchases.  
   - Collect data for at least **one full menstrual cycle (‚âà 28‚Äì35 days)** to ensure a balanced sample of both conditions.

2. **Data Cleaning:**  
   - Merge the two sources (consumption + period tracking) by date.  
   - Remove missing or duplicate records.  
   - Create a binary variable: `on_period` = 1 (yes) / 0 (no).  
   - Normalize sweet consumption scale if using mixed units (e.g., portions, grams).  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Compare **average sweet consumption on period days vs non-period days**.  
   - Visualize the distribution of consumption (histograms, boxplots).  

4. **Hypothesis:**  
   - My sweet consumption is higher on period days compared to non-period days.

5. **Visualization:**  
   - Boxplot comparing ‚Äúon period‚Äù vs ‚Äúnot on period‚Äù sweet consumption.  
   - Line plot showing day-to-day variation in consumption with shaded regions marking period days.

##  Expected Outcomes
- Determine whether sweet consumption significantly increases during period days.  
- Quantify the difference between average consumption on vs off period.
